            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am still confused what to do. I like making stuff on the computer. It doesn't matter what it is, a game or some dumb website. I love creating something. Now I learned <span class="bold">JS</span> so I have a plan to learn some more web development. I am still exploring. Currently, my goal is to learn some <span class="bold">JS</span> frameworks/libraries like <span class="bold">React</span>, <span class="bold">NextJs</span>, <span class="bold">ExpressJs</span>, etc. But I also want to dip my hand into the game dev. I know you should stick to one. and I will stick to web development first. Because I think it will be easy for me. I tried game development and I can say one thing for sure. It's hard both for me and my potato laptop. So currently I am sticking to Web development.</p>

        <section id="plans" class="sec">
            <h1>Plans</h1>
            <p>I know I am no Neal of <a href="https://neal.fun/">Neal.fun</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen">ThePrimeTime</a> of Netflix and certainly not <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox">Toby Fox</a> of <a href="https://undertale.com/">Undertale</a>. But I still wanna build my small things. So that's why I wanna make it into the industry somehow. I don't know how to do it yet. Because I may not be a genius(quite the contrary, I am dumb.)But I have confidence and lots of love for computers. So, my plan, for now, is to learn full-stack development and acquire more skills in the industry. Web development is also a lot of fun for me. because I learn by doing some useless project. You can subscribe to me on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@1ZABBO1">YouTube</a> if you want to see those projects. So like I said in the goals I will stick to web development for now. And I know I am making no sense at this point and talking about the same boring things but I just need more text to the site that's why I am yapping lol.</p>
